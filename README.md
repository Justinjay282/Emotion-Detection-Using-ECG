<h1>***Emotion Detection Using ECG***</h1> <br>

__Project Details__
- Conducted data preprocessing
- Conducted data analysis
- Predicted Emotions
- Conducted Hyperparameter Tuning using ```GridSearchCV```

__Dataset Details__
- Title: Young Adult's Affective Data (YAAD) Using ECG and GSR Signals
- From: Mendeley Data
- URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/g2p7vwxyn2/4

**Future Improvements**
- Use more datasets with accurate ECG readings
- Use deep learning models
- Solve overfitting issues

*Note*: This project was only limited to the ECG readings of individuals with cognitive disorders, the GSR data was not used.
